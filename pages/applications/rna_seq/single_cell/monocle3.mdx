Monocle 3 is a computational tool for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, 
specializing in inferring dynamic biological processes such as cell differentiation. 
It reconstructs developmental trajectories, calculates pseudotime, identifies differentially 
expressed genes, and offers visualization tools. Monocle 3 is widely used in research fields 
like developmental biology and cancer biology to study cell fate decisions and gene regulatory
networks at the single-cell level.For more information
