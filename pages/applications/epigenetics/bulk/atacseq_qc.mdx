**ATACseqQC** is  tool specifically designed for the quality control (QC)
analysis of ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) data. 
It offers a range of functions and metrics to assess the quality and reliability of 
ATAC-seq experiments. ATAC-seq is a powerful technique used to study chromatin accessibility,
which provides insights into the regulatory regions of the genome.

**Key features of ATACseqQC include:**

- Basic statistics summarizing the data, such as read counts and fragment length distributions.
- Assessment of fragment size distribution, PCR amplification biases, and potential PCR duplicates.
- Evaluation of GC content bias and nucleosome positioning analysis.
- Calculation of signal-to-noise ratio and fragment enrichment in specific genomic regions.
