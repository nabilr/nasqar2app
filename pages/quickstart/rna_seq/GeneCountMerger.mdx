## GeneCountMerger



This is a simple preprocessing tool to merge individual gene count files (Eg. output count files from htseq). 

**NOTE:** the first column must contain the genes.

**Fetaures**

- Merge individual sample count files Or merge multiple matrices
    > See sample input files below for more details
     
- Convert ensembl gene IDs to gene names
    * Option to choose from available genome/versions
    * If genome/version is not available in the options and you have a .gtf file for your genome follow these instructions.

- Option to add pseudocounts (+1)
- Download merged counts file in .csv format
- Transcriptome Analysis (Optional) after merging your counts:
    * Use our Seurat Wizard to carry out single-cell RNA analysis
    * Use DESeq2Shiny or START apps to carry out bulk RNA analysis
    * If there are NO replicates , use DESeq2Shiny app for exploratory analysis
